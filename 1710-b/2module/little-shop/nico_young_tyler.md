## Evaluation Rubric

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* Exceeds Expectations: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions and project is depoyed
**Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented and project is deployed**
* Below Expectations: There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented and/or project is not fully deployed

### 2. Views

* Exceeds Expectations: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
**Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through**
* Below Expectations: Views don't make use of partials or show weak understanding of `render`

### 3. Controllers

* Exceeds Expectations: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
**Meets Expectations: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts**
* Below Expectations: There are four to seven ugly controller methods that should have been refactored

### 4. Models

* Exceeds Expectations: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
**Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring**
* Below Expectations: Models are somewhat messy and/or make poor use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* Exceeds Expectations: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
**Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels but fails to cover some features**
* Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels

### 6. Usability

**Exceeds Expectations: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers**
* Meets Expectations: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
* Below Expectations: Project needs more attention to the User Experience, but works

### 7. Workflow

**Exceeds Expectations: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.**
* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
* Below Expectations: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
