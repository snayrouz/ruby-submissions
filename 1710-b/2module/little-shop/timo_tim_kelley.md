For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* Below Expectations: There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented and/or project is not fully deployed

### 2. Views

* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* Meets Expectations: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. Testing

* Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels

### 6. Usability

* Meets Expectations: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* Exceeds Expectations: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
