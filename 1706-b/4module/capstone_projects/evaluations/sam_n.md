Self Assessment Rubric
------------

_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

- Meets Expectations: I believe I had a great plan and was able to break features down to have a great Git workflow. However, I wasn't able to implement large files on Github so in terms of moving things locally to Github, I wasn't able to fully accomplish that.


### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).


- Meets Expectations: With my project management tool, I was able to build features out in sprints and address bugs as they came. I communicated about challenges and scope change with my Technical Lead when I foresaw a bump in the road.


### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.


- Meets Expectations: Code is well organized with code marks put into the codebase for a developer to understand the functionality of each function.


### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Above Expectations: Implements Swift 4, Python Virtual Environment, CoreML Tools, AWS Amazon Machine Image Instance

### 5. Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations: The READme is basically the framework for my tutorial blog post (coming when I have time) to help
train your own dataset and convert it to implement in Swift for iOS. Once the user has the CoreML model, they can basically create any machine learning app in iOS using that model.


### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Meets Expectations: This was hard because the iPhone comes with it's own accessibility tools so how I took this challenge on was reading more about design and typography accessibility in iOS apps.
