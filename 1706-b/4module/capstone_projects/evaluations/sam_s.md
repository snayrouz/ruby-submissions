_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

I didn't do branches and PRs because the project was solo, but I think the project uses good git practices and commit messages.

- Meets Expectations

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).

I planned ahead, and made some scope adjustments along the way, though should have been more forthcoming with the place I was at in the final week.

- Meets Expectations

### Evaluated By: Katelyn

### Notes:

- Not deployed only working locally
- Started with waffle but fell off a bit on keeping up with it
- Detailed iteration map but would have loved to see the iteration broken up into pieces on a pm tool
- Lack of PRs and branches
- `CreateBar.js` long and a lot going on. Would help to break up that functionality a bit
- Lack of documentation on the FE & BE
