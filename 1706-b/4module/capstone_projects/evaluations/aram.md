Meets Expectations. I could have done better here, but I did work to break things out into smaller parts and keep track on Waffle.

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).

- Above Expectations

Meets Expectations. Again, could have been better, but I did talk with my lead throughout the project to let her know where I was and what my struggles were.

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

Meets expectations. I feel like this one is hard. The code was all in a language I had never done before, and don't know the idiomatic use of. I feel like I did okay given that fact.

### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

I'd say here I'm above expectations. Literally every part of the project was in a new technology.

### 5. Documentation

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations

Meets expectations. I think my readme is pretty clear and outlines the pertinent information someone looking at my project would need to know.

### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

Here I'm Below Expectations. I wanted to go back and do more accessibility stuff, but I just ran out of time.
