### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)


- Meets Expectations

KanBan Board was broke down into granular tasks for the project being a first with React-Native.  Git commits and descriptions were below expectations but the pre-planning with iteration map and kan ban board essentially is what kept the project going off the rails.  Management of expectations also was important.


### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).


- Meets Expectations

Multiple scope adjustments.  Introducution and rebuild of app with expo, react-navigation, and redux became a huge scope adjustment.  Project in scope posed many unforseen complications that I failed to plan or forsee coming.


### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.


- Meets Expectations
Code is well organized.


### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Above Expectations
There was definitely enough to maybe too many. 


### 5. Documentation

- Meets Expectations
New concept for me to think about when dealing with mobile phones.
