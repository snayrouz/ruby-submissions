Self Assessment Rubric

_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations** - I worked from an iteration map and broke the front-end and back-ends components into two separate projects tracked on waffle.io.  I used branches to develop features, and tried to keep commits reasonable sized and appropriately descriptive so my process could be tracked.  I think I could have improved by breaking some of the waffle cards into smaller pieces and utilizing user stories more.  
- Below Expectations

### 2. Completion & Pace

Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way. Developer communicates adjustments to Technical Lead as soon as possible (if necessary).

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations** - I communicated to my tech lead my progress and what I thought I could accomplish within the time frame.  
- Below Expectations

### 3. Implementation Quality

Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions and best practices.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- **Below Expectations** - I feel like I did a good job with the front-end code.  I wasn't able to refactor the back-end code so it works but it needs to be cleaned up.  I also did not use TDD because I didn't have time to learn it in addition to the new programming language and framework.  

### 4. Application of Techniques

Developer implements four new techniques or patterns.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations** - Back-end: Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. Front-end: JavaScript & jQuery utilizing webpack    
- Below Expectations

### 5. Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations** - I included readmes for both projects and provided a documentation page at the root of my back-end site  
- Below Expectations

### 6. Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- **Below Expectations** - This was in the plan, but I ran out of time.  I did not make any extra effort to implement accessibilty.
